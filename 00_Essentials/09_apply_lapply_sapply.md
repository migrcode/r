# The apply() - family of functions

This family consists of the following functions:
* The `apply()` functions for matrices
* The `lapply()` function for data frames, lists or vectors
* The `sapply()` function which is similar to lapply but simplifies the output


## lapply()

We use `lapply()` if we want to apply a function to every element of a list and obtain a list as a result.
