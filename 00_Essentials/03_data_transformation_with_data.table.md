# Data transformation with data.table

The `data.table` package is an extremely fast and memory efficient package for transforming data in R.

The basics of working with data.tables are:

**dt[i, j, by]**
* Take data.table **dt**, 
* subset rows using **i** and
* manipulate columns with **j**, 
* grouped according to **by**.

## Create a data.table

`setDT(df)` converts a data frame or a list to a data.table

## Subset rows using i

`dt[1:2,]` – subset rows based on row numbers

`dt[a>5,]` – subset rows based on values in one or more columns

(Operators: `%in%`, `%like%`, `%between%`, `|`, `%`, `is.na()` ...)

## Manipulate colums with j

`dt[, c(2)]` – extract columns by number or drop columns with "-"

`dt[, .(b,c)]` – extract columns by name

## Summarize

`dt[, .(x = sum(a))]` – create a data.table with new columns based on summarized values of rows. 

(Functions: `mean()`, `median()`, `max()`, ...)

## Convert

`dt[, b := as.integer(b)]` – convert the type of a column

## Group according to by

`dt[,j, by = .(a)]` – group rows by values in specific columns

`dt[,j, keyby = .(a)]` – group and sort rows by values in specific columns

## Unique rows

`uniqueN(dt, by = c("a", "b"))` – count the number of unique rows based on columns specified in "by". leave out the "N" to really extract unique rows

## Rename columns

`setnames(dt, c("a", "b"), c("x,"y"))` – rename columns

## Inner join

`dt_a[dt_b, on = .(b = y)] – join data.tables on rows with equal values
