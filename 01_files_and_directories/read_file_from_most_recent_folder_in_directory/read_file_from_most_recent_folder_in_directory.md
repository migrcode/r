# Read a file from the most recent folder in a directory

I wrote a script which purpose is to look for the most recent folder within a directory based on the creation time of that folder. The script automatically reads a .csv file which is contained in the that folder. However, if there is no folder for the current week yet, the script reads the .csv file from last week's folder.
